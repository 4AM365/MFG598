Qn3
Assuming the following data structures capture values obtained from a source
itemsN = ["obj1", "obj2", "obj3", "obj4", "obj5"]
locXYZ = [(3.0, 4.0, 2.0), (3.0, 1.0, 2.0), (6.0, 4.0, 2.0), (.6, 8.9, 4.5), (7.6, 9.9, 4.5)]
Write a script that combines this data into a single dictionary
with keys in itemsN, and the corresponding value being the records in locXYZ

Qn6
6.	A user has two standard dices. Each dice has values from 1 through 6. 
The user throws each set of 2 dices 30 times. Simulate this action using a Python script.
Your script must store the value on each dice that appears for each throw. 
a) After 30 throws are completed, find the total sum of the scores obtained by both dices across the 30 throws. 
b) Repeat the simulation of 30 throws, 10 times, record the total Sum obtained each time in a list.
